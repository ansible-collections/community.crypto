  1.0.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - 'ACME modules: fix bug in ACME v1 account update code'
      - 'ACME modules: make sure some connection errors are handled properly'
      - 'ACME modules: support Buypass'' ACME v1 endpoint'
      - acme_certificate - fix crash when module is used with Python 2.x.
      - acme_certificate - fix misbehavior when ACME v1 is used with ``modify_account``
        set to ``false``.
      - 'ecs_certificate - Always specify header ``connection: keep-alive`` for ECS
        API connections.'
      - ecs_certificate - Fix formatting of contents of ``full_chain_path``.
      - get_certificate - Fix cryptography backend when pyopenssl is unavailable (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67900)
      - openssh_keypair - add logic to avoid breaking password protected keys.
      - openssh_keypair - fixes idempotence issue with public key (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64969).
      - openssh_keypair - public key's file attributes (permissions, owner, group,
        etc.) are now set to the same values as the private key.
      - openssl_* modules - prevent crash on fingerprint determination in FIPS mode
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67213).
      - 'openssl_certificate - When provider is ``entrust``, use a ``connection: keep-alive``
        header for ECS API connections.'
      - openssl_certificate - ``provider`` option was documented as required, but
        it was not checked whether it was provided. It is now only required when ``state``
        is ``present``.
      - openssl_certificate - fix ``assertonly`` provider certificate verification,
        causing 'private key mismatch' and 'subject mismatch' errors.
      - openssl_certificate and openssl_csr - fix Ed25519 and Ed448 private key support
        for ``cryptography`` backend. This probably needs at least cryptography 2.8,
        since older versions have problems with signing certificates or CSRs with
        such keys. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59039, PR https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/63984)
      - openssl_csr - a warning is issued if an unsupported value for ``version``
        is used for the ``cryptography`` backend.
      - openssl_csr - the module will now enforce that ``privatekey_path`` is specified
        when ``state=present``.
      - openssl_publickey - fix a module crash caused when pyOpenSSL is not installed
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67035).
      deprecated_features:
      - openssl_csr - all values for the ``version`` option except ``1`` are deprecated.
        The value 1 denotes the current only standardized CSR version.
      minor_changes:
      - luks_device - accept ``passphrase``, ``new_passphrase`` and ``remove_passphrase``.
      - luks_device - add ``keysize`` parameter to set key size at LUKS container
        creation
      - luks_device - added support to use UUIDs, and labels with LUKS2 containers
      - luks_device - added the ``type`` option that allows user explicit define the
        LUKS container format version
      - openssh_keypair - instead of regenerating some broken or password protected
        keys, fail the module. Keys can still be regenerated by calling the module
        with ``force=yes``.
      - openssh_keypair - the ``regenerate`` option allows to configure the module's
        behavior when it should or needs to regenerate private keys.
      - openssl_* modules - the cryptography backend now properly supports ``dirName``,
        ``otherName`` and ``RID`` (Registered ID) names.
      - openssl_certificate - Add option for changing which ACME directory to use
        with acme-tiny. Set the default ACME directory to Let's Encrypt instead of
        using acme-tiny's default. (acme-tiny also uses Let's Encrypt at the time
        being, so no action should be neccessary.)
      - openssl_certificate - Change the required version of acme-tiny to >= 4.0.0
      - openssl_certificate - allow to provide content of some input files via the
        ``csr_content``, ``privatekey_content``, ``ownca_privatekey_content`` and
        ``ownca_content`` options.
      - openssl_certificate - allow to return the existing/generated certificate directly
        as ``certificate`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_certificate_info - allow to provide certificate content via ``content``
        option (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64776).
      - openssl_csr - Add support for specifying the SAN ``otherName`` value in the
        OpenSSL ASN.1 UTF8 string format, ``otherName:<OID>;UTF8:string value``.
      - openssl_csr - allow to provide private key content via ``private_key_content``
        option.
      - openssl_csr - allow to return the existing/generated CSR directly as ``csr``
        by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_csr_info - allow to provide CSR content via ``content`` option.
      - openssl_dhparam - allow to return the existing/generated DH params directly
        as ``dhparams`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_dhparam - now supports a ``cryptography``-based backend. Auto-detection
        can be overwritten with the ``select_crypto_backend`` option.
      - openssl_pkcs12 - allow to return the existing/generated PKCS#12 directly as
        ``pkcs12`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_privatekey - add ``format`` and ``format_mismatch`` options.
      - openssl_privatekey - allow to return the existing/generated private key directly
        as ``privatekey`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_privatekey - the ``regenerate`` option allows to configure the module's
        behavior when it should or needs to regenerate private keys.
      - openssl_privatekey_info - allow to provide private key content via ``content``
        option.
      - openssl_publickey - allow to provide private key content via ``private_key_content``
        option.
      - openssl_publickey - allow to return the existing/generated public key directly
        as ``publickey`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.

        fingerprints (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/121).
      release_summary: Please note that this release fixes a security issue (CVE-2020-25646).
      security_fixes:
      - openssl_csr - the option ``privatekey_content`` was not marked as ``no_log``,
        resulting in it being dumped into the system log by default, and returned
        in the registered results in the ``invocation`` field (CVE-2020-25646, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/125).
      - openssl_privatekey_info - the option ``content`` was not marked as ``no_log``,

  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - openssl_pkcs12 - report the correct state when ``action`` is ``parse`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/143).
      - support code - improve handling of certificate and certificate signing request
        (CSR) loading with the ``cryptography`` backend when errors occur (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/138,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/139).
      - x509_certificate - fix ``entrust`` provider, which was broken since community.crypto
        0.1.0 due to a feature added before the collection move (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).
      minor_changes:
      - openssh_cert - add module parameter ``use_agent`` to enable using signing
        keys stored in ssh-agent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/116).
      - openssl_csr - refactor module to allow code re-use by openssl_csr_pipe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/123).
      - openssl_privatekey - refactor module to allow code re-use by openssl_privatekey_pipe
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/119).
      - openssl_privatekey - the elliptic curve ``secp192r1`` now triggers a security
        warning. Elliptic curves of at least 224 bits should be used for new keys;
        see `here <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/ec.html#elliptic-curves>`_
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/132).
      - x509_certificate - for the ``selfsigned`` provider, a CSR is not required
        anymore. If no CSR is provided, the module behaves as if a minimal CSR which
        only contains the public key has been provided (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/32,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/129).
      - x509_certificate - refactor module to allow code re-use by x509_certificate_pipe
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).
      release_summary: 'Contains new modules ``openssl_privatekey_pipe``, ``openssl_csr_pipe``
        and ``x509_certificate_pipe`` which allow to create or update private keys,

  1.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - acme_certificate - error when requested challenge type is not found for non-valid
        challenges, instead of hanging on step 2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/171,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/173).
      minor_changes:
      - The ACME module_utils has been relicensed back from the Simplified BSD License
        (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) to the GPLv3+ (same license
        used by most other code in this collection). This undoes a licensing change
        when the original GPLv3+ licensed code was moved to module_utils in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40697
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/165).
      - The ``crypto/identify.py`` module_utils has been renamed to ``crypto/pem.py``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).
      - luks_device - ``new_keyfile``, ``new_passphrase``, ``remove_keyfile`` and
        ``remove_passphrase`` are now idempotent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/19,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/168).
      - luks_device - allow to configure PBKDF (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/163).
      - openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - allow to specify CRL distribution endpoints
        with ``crl_distribution_points`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/147,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/167).
      - openssl_pkcs12 - allow to specify certificate bundles in ``other_certificates``
        by using new option ``other_certificates_parse_all`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/149,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).

  1.5.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - openssl_csr - no longer fails when comparing CSR without basic constraint
        when ``basic_constraints`` is specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/179,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/180).
      deprecated_features:
      - acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders=url_list``, ``orders`` will no
        longer be returned in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use ``order_uris`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178).
      minor_changes:
      - acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders`` is not ``ignore`` and the ACME
        server allows to query orders, the new return value ``order_uris`` is always
        populated with a list of URIs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178).
      - luks_device - allow to specify sector size for LUKS2 containers with new ``sector_size``
        parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/193).
      release_summary: Regular feature and bugfix release. Deprecates a return value.

      - openssl_privatekey_pipe - make compatible with latest changes in ansible-core
        2.11.0b3 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/202).
      deprecated_features:
      - acme module_utils - the ``acme`` module_utils (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme``)
        is deprecated and will be removed in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use the new Python
        modules in the ``acme`` package instead (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme.xxx``)
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
      minor_changes:
      - acme module_utils - the ``acme`` module_utils has been split up into several
        Python modules (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
      - acme_* modules - codebase refactor which should not be visible to end-users
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
      - acme_* modules - support account key passphrases for ``cryptography`` backend
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/197, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).
      - acme_certificate_revoke - support revoking by private keys that are passphrase
        protected for ``cryptography`` backend (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).
      - acme_challenge_cert_helper - add ``private_key_passphrase`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).
      release_summary: Fixes compatibility issues with the latest ansible-core 2.11
        beta, and contains a lot of internal refactoring for the ACME modules and
        support for private key passphrases for them.

        keypairs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/113,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/230).
      - various modules - prevent crashes when modules try to set attributes on not
        yet existing files in check mode. This will be fixed in ansible-core 2.12,
        but it is not backported to every Ansible version we support (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issue/242,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/243).
      - x509_certificate - fix crash when ``assertonly`` provider is used and some

        library or the OpenSSH binary for the execution of actions performed by ``openssh_keypair``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/236).
      - openssh_keypair - added ``passphrase`` parameter for encrypting/decrypting
        OpenSSH private keys (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/225).

        backend. This requires cryptography 3.0 or newer, and does not support the
        ``iter_size`` and ``maciter_size`` options (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/234).
      - openssl_privatekey - add diff mode (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/38,

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - keypair_backend module utils - simplify code to pass sanity tests (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/263).
      - openssh_keypair - fixed ``cryptography`` backend to preserve original file
        permissions when regenerating a keypair requires existing files to be overwritten
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/260).
      - openssh_keypair - fixed error handling to restore original keypair if regeneration
        fails (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/260).

      minor_changes:
      - get_certificate - added ``starttls`` option to retrieve certificates from
        servers which require clients to request an encrypted connection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/264).

  1.9.4:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - acme_* modules - fix commands composed for OpenSSL backend to retrieve information
        on CSRs and certificates from stdin to use ``/dev/stdin`` instead of ``-``.
        This is needed for OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, apparently (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/279).
      - acme_challenge_cert_helper - only return exception when cryptography is not
        installed, not when a too old version of it is installed. This prevents Ansible's
        callback to crash (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/281).
