  1.0.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - 'ACME modules: fix bug in ACME v1 account update code'
      - 'ACME modules: make sure some connection errors are handled properly'
      - 'ACME modules: support Buypass'' ACME v1 endpoint'
      - acme_certificate - fix crash when module is used with Python 2.x.
      - acme_certificate - fix misbehavior when ACME v1 is used with ``modify_account``
        set to ``false``.
      - 'ecs_certificate - Always specify header ``connection: keep-alive`` for ECS
        API connections.'
      - ecs_certificate - Fix formatting of contents of ``full_chain_path``.
      - get_certificate - Fix cryptography backend when pyopenssl is unavailable (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67900)
      - openssh_keypair - add logic to avoid breaking password protected keys.
      - openssh_keypair - fixes idempotence issue with public key (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64969).
      - openssh_keypair - public key's file attributes (permissions, owner, group,
        etc.) are now set to the same values as the private key.
      - openssl_* modules - prevent crash on fingerprint determination in FIPS mode
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67213).
      - 'openssl_certificate - When provider is ``entrust``, use a ``connection: keep-alive``
        header for ECS API connections.'
      - openssl_certificate - ``provider`` option was documented as required, but
        it was not checked whether it was provided. It is now only required when ``state``
        is ``present``.
      - openssl_certificate - fix ``assertonly`` provider certificate verification,
        causing 'private key mismatch' and 'subject mismatch' errors.
      - openssl_certificate and openssl_csr - fix Ed25519 and Ed448 private key support
        for ``cryptography`` backend. This probably needs at least cryptography 2.8,
        since older versions have problems with signing certificates or CSRs with
        such keys. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59039, PR https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/63984)
      - openssl_csr - a warning is issued if an unsupported value for ``version``
        is used for the ``cryptography`` backend.
      - openssl_csr - the module will now enforce that ``privatekey_path`` is specified
        when ``state=present``.
      - openssl_publickey - fix a module crash caused when pyOpenSSL is not installed
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67035).
      deprecated_features:
      - openssl_csr - all values for the ``version`` option except ``1`` are deprecated.
        The value 1 denotes the current only standardized CSR version.
      minor_changes:
      - luks_device - accept ``passphrase``, ``new_passphrase`` and ``remove_passphrase``.
      - luks_device - add ``keysize`` parameter to set key size at LUKS container
        creation
      - luks_device - added support to use UUIDs, and labels with LUKS2 containers
      - luks_device - added the ``type`` option that allows user explicit define the
        LUKS container format version
      - openssh_keypair - instead of regenerating some broken or password protected
        keys, fail the module. Keys can still be regenerated by calling the module
        with ``force=yes``.
      - openssh_keypair - the ``regenerate`` option allows to configure the module's
        behavior when it should or needs to regenerate private keys.
      - openssl_* modules - the cryptography backend now properly supports ``dirName``,
        ``otherName`` and ``RID`` (Registered ID) names.
      - openssl_certificate - Add option for changing which ACME directory to use
        with acme-tiny. Set the default ACME directory to Let's Encrypt instead of
        using acme-tiny's default. (acme-tiny also uses Let's Encrypt at the time
        being, so no action should be neccessary.)
      - openssl_certificate - Change the required version of acme-tiny to >= 4.0.0
      - openssl_certificate - allow to provide content of some input files via the
        ``csr_content``, ``privatekey_content``, ``ownca_privatekey_content`` and
        ``ownca_content`` options.
      - openssl_certificate - allow to return the existing/generated certificate directly
        as ``certificate`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_certificate_info - allow to provide certificate content via ``content``
        option (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64776).
      - openssl_csr - Add support for specifying the SAN ``otherName`` value in the
        OpenSSL ASN.1 UTF8 string format, ``otherName:<OID>;UTF8:string value``.
      - openssl_csr - allow to provide private key content via ``private_key_content``
        option.
      - openssl_csr - allow to return the existing/generated CSR directly as ``csr``
        by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_csr_info - allow to provide CSR content via ``content`` option.
      - openssl_dhparam - allow to return the existing/generated DH params directly
        as ``dhparams`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_dhparam - now supports a ``cryptography``-based backend. Auto-detection
        can be overwritten with the ``select_crypto_backend`` option.
      - openssl_pkcs12 - allow to return the existing/generated PKCS#12 directly as
        ``pkcs12`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_privatekey - add ``format`` and ``format_mismatch`` options.
      - openssl_privatekey - allow to return the existing/generated private key directly
        as ``privatekey`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
      - openssl_privatekey - the ``regenerate`` option allows to configure the module's
        behavior when it should or needs to regenerate private keys.
      - openssl_privatekey_info - allow to provide private key content via ``content``
        option.
      - openssl_publickey - allow to provide private key content via ``private_key_content``
        option.
      - openssl_publickey - allow to return the existing/generated public key directly
        as ``publickey`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.

        fingerprints (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/121).
      release_summary: Please note that this release fixes a security issue (CVE-2020-25646).
      security_fixes:
      - openssl_csr - the option ``privatekey_content`` was not marked as ``no_log``,
        resulting in it being dumped into the system log by default, and returned
        in the registered results in the ``invocation`` field (CVE-2020-25646, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/125).
      - openssl_privatekey_info - the option ``content`` was not marked as ``no_log``,

  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - openssl_pkcs12 - report the correct state when ``action`` is ``parse`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/143).
      - support code - improve handling of certificate and certificate signing request
        (CSR) loading with the ``cryptography`` backend when errors occur (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/138,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/139).
      - x509_certificate - fix ``entrust`` provider, which was broken since community.crypto
        0.1.0 due to a feature added before the collection move (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).
      minor_changes:
      - openssh_cert - add module parameter ``use_agent`` to enable using signing
        keys stored in ssh-agent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/116).
      - openssl_csr - refactor module to allow code re-use by openssl_csr_pipe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/123).
      - openssl_privatekey - refactor module to allow code re-use by openssl_privatekey_pipe
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/119).
      - openssl_privatekey - the elliptic curve ``secp192r1`` now triggers a security
        warning. Elliptic curves of at least 224 bits should be used for new keys;
        see `here <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/ec.html#elliptic-curves>`_
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/132).
      - x509_certificate - for the ``selfsigned`` provider, a CSR is not required
        anymore. If no CSR is provided, the module behaves as if a minimal CSR which
        only contains the public key has been provided (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/32,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/129).
      - x509_certificate - refactor module to allow code re-use by x509_certificate_pipe
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).
      release_summary: 'Contains new modules ``openssl_privatekey_pipe``, ``openssl_csr_pipe``
        and ``x509_certificate_pipe`` which allow to create or update private keys,

  1.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - acme_certificate - error when requested challenge type is not found for non-valid
        challenges, instead of hanging on step 2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/171,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/173).
      minor_changes:
      - The ACME module_utils has been relicensed back from the Simplified BSD License
        (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) to the GPLv3+ (same license
        used by most other code in this collection). This undoes a licensing change
        when the original GPLv3+ licensed code was moved to module_utils in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40697
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/165).
      - The ``crypto/identify.py`` module_utils has been renamed to ``crypto/pem.py``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).
      - luks_device - ``new_keyfile``, ``new_passphrase``, ``remove_keyfile`` and
        ``remove_passphrase`` are now idempotent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/19,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/168).
      - luks_device - allow to configure PBKDF (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/163).
      - openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - allow to specify CRL distribution endpoints
        with ``crl_distribution_points`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/147,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/167).
      - openssl_pkcs12 - allow to specify certificate bundles in ``other_certificates``
        by using new option ``other_certificates_parse_all`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/149,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).

  1.5.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - openssl_csr - no longer fails when comparing CSR without basic constraint
        when ``basic_constraints`` is specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/179,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/180).
      deprecated_features:
      - acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders=url_list``, ``orders`` will no
        longer be returned in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use ``order_uris`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178).
      minor_changes:
      - acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders`` is not ``ignore`` and the ACME
        server allows to query orders, the new return value ``order_uris`` is always
        populated with a list of URIs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178).
      - luks_device - allow to specify sector size for LUKS2 containers with new ``sector_size``
        parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/193).
      release_summary: Regular feature and bugfix release. Deprecates a return value.

      - openssl_privatekey_pipe - make compatible with latest changes in ansible-core
        2.11.0b3 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/202).
      deprecated_features:
      - acme module_utils - the ``acme`` module_utils (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme``)
        is deprecated and will be removed in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use the new Python
        modules in the ``acme`` package instead (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme.xxx``)
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
      minor_changes:
      - acme module_utils - the ``acme`` module_utils has been split up into several
        Python modules (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
      - acme_* modules - codebase refactor which should not be visible to end-users
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
      - acme_* modules - support account key passphrases for ``cryptography`` backend
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/197, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).
      - acme_certificate_revoke - support revoking by private keys that are passphrase
        protected for ``cryptography`` backend (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).
      - acme_challenge_cert_helper - add ``private_key_passphrase`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).
      release_summary: Fixes compatibility issues with the latest ansible-core 2.11
        beta, and contains a lot of internal refactoring for the ACME modules and
        support for private key passphrases for them.

      - openssh_keypair - fix ``check_mode`` to populate return values for existing
        keypairs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/113,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/230).
      - various modules - prevent crashes when modules try to set attributes on not
        yet existing files in check mode. This will be fixed in ansible-core 2.12,
        but it is not backported to every Ansible version we support (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issue/242,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/243).
      - x509_certificate - fix crash when ``assertonly`` provider is used and some
        error conditions should be reported (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/240,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/241).
      minor_changes:
      - cryptography_openssh module utils - new module_utils for managing asymmetric
        keypairs and OpenSSH formatted/encoded asymmetric keypairs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/213).
      - openssh_keypair - added ``backend`` parameter for selecting between the cryptography
        library or the OpenSSH binary for the execution of actions performed by ``openssh_keypair``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/236).
      - openssh_keypair - added ``passphrase`` parameter for encrypting/decrypting
        OpenSSH private keys (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/225).

        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/150).
      - openssl_csr_info - now returns ``public_key_type`` and ``public_key_data``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/233).
      - openssl_csr_info - refactor module to allow code re-use for diff mode (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/204).

      - openssl_pkcs12 - added option ``select_crypto_backend`` and a ``cryptography``
        backend. This requires cryptography 3.0 or newer, and does not support the
        ``iter_size`` and ``maciter_size`` options (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/234).
      - openssl_privatekey - add diff mode (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/38,

      - openssh_keypair - fixed a bug that prevented custom file attributes being
        applied to public keys (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/257).
      minor_changes:

        available since at least Ansible 2.9 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/253).
      - openssh certificate module utils - new module_utils for parsing OpenSSH certificates
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/246).
      - openssh_cert - added ``regenerate`` option to validate additional certificate
        parameters which trigger regeneration of an existing certificate (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/256).

      bugfixes:
      - keypair_backend module utils - simplify code to pass sanity tests (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/263).
      - openssh_keypair - fixed ``cryptography`` backend to preserve original file
        permissions when regenerating a keypair requires existing files to be overwritten
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/260).
      - openssh_keypair - fixed error handling to restore original keypair if regeneration

        to compare strings with the cryptography backend. This fixes idempotency problems
        with non-ASCII letters on Python 2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/270,

        This is needed for OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, apparently (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/279).
      - acme_challenge_cert_helper - only return exception when cryptography is not
        installed, not when a too old version of it is installed. This prevents Ansible's
        callback to crash (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/281).

  2.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Adjust ``dirName`` text parsing and to text converting code to conform to
        `Sections 2 and 3 of RFC 4514 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4514.html>`_.
        This is similar to how `cryptography handles this <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/x509/reference/#cryptography.x509.Name.rfc4514_string>`_
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/274).
      - acme module utils - removing compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/290).
      - acme_* modules - removed vendored copy of the Python library ``ipaddress``.
        If you are using Python 2.x, please make sure to install the library (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/287).
      - compatibility module_utils - removed vendored copy of the Python library ``ipaddress``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/287).
      - crypto module utils - removing compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/290).
      - get_certificate, openssl_csr_info, x509_certificate_info - depending on the
        ``cryptography`` version used, the modules might not return the ASN.1 value
        for an extension as contained in the certificate respectively CSR, but a re-encoded
        version of it. This should usually be identical to the value contained in
        the source file, unless the value was malformed. For extensions not handled
        by C(cryptography) the value contained in the source file is always returned
        unaltered (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/318).
      - module_utils - removed various PyOpenSSL support functions and default backend
        values that are not needed for the openssl_pkcs12 module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/273).
      - openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe, x509_crl - the ``subject`` respectively ``issuer``
        fields no longer ignore empty values, but instead fail when encountering them
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
      - openssl_privatekey_info - by default consistency checks are not run; they
        need to be explicitly requested by passing ``check_consistency=true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/309).
      - x509_crl - for idempotency checks, the ``issuer`` order is ignored. If order
        is important, use the new ``issuer_ordered`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
      bugfixes:
      - cryptography backend - improve Unicode handling for Python 2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/313).
      - get_certificate - fix compatibility with the cryptography 35.0.0 release (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/294).
      - openssl_csr_info - fix compatibility with the cryptography 35.0.0 release
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/294).
      - openssl_pkcs12 - fix compatibility with the cryptography 35.0.0 release (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/296).
      - x509_certificate_info - fix compatibility with the cryptography 35.0.0 release
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/294).
      deprecated_features:
      - acme_* modules - ACME version 1 is now deprecated and support for it will
        be removed in community.crypto 2.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/288).
      minor_changes:
      - acme_certificate - the ``subject`` and ``issuer`` fields in in the ``select_chain``
        entries are now more strictly validated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
      - openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - provide a new ``subject_ordered`` option if
        the order of the components in the subject is of importance (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/291,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
      - openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - there is now stricter validation of the values
        of the ``subject`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
      - openssl_privatekey_info - add ``check_consistency`` option to request private
        key consistency checks to be done (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/309).
      - x509_certificate, x509_certificate_pipe - add ``ignore_timestamps`` option
        which allows to enable idempotency for 'not before' and 'not after' options
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/295, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/317).
      - x509_crl - provide a new ``issuer_ordered`` option if the order of the components
        in the issuer is of importance (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/291,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
      - x509_crl - there is now stricter validation of the values of the ``issuer``
        option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
      release_summary: 'A new major release of the ``community.crypto`` collection.
        The main changes are removal of the PyOpenSSL backends for almost all modules
        (``openssl_pkcs12`` being the only exception), and removal of the ``assertonly``
        provider in the ``x509_certificate`` provider. There are also some other breaking
        changes which should improve the user interface/experience of this collection
        long-term.

  2.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - acme_certificate - avoid passing multiple certificates to ``cryptography``'s
        X.509 certificate loader when ``fullchain_dest`` is used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/324).
      - get_certificate, openssl_csr_info, x509_certificate_info - add fallback code
        for extension parsing that works with cryptography 36.0.0 and newer. This
        code re-serializes de-serialized extensions and thus can return slightly different
        values if the extension in the original CSR resp. certificate was not canonicalized
        correctly. This code is currently used as a fallback if the existing code
        stops working, but we will switch it to be the main code in a future release
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/331).
      - luks_device - now also runs a built-in LUKS signature cleaner on ``state=absent``
        to make sure that also the secondary LUKS2 header is wiped when older versions
        of wipefs are used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/326,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/327).
      - openssl_pkcs12 - use new PKCS#12 deserialization infrastructure from cryptography
        36.0.0 if available (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/302).
      minor_changes:
      - acme_* modules - fix usage of ``fetch_url`` with changes in latest ansible-core
        ``devel`` branch (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/339).

  2.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Various modules and plugins - use vendored version of ``distutils.version``
        instead of the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/353).
      - certificate_complete_chain - do not append root twice if the chain already
        ends with a root certificate (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/360).
      - certificate_complete_chain - do not hang when infinite loop is found (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/355,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/360).
      minor_changes:

  2.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - luks_devices - set ``LANG`` and similar environment variables to avoid translated
        output, which can break some of the module's functionality like key management
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/388, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/385).
      minor_changes:
      - openssh_cert - added ``ignore_timestamps`` parameter so it can be used semi-idempotent
        with relative timestamps in ``valid_to``/``valid_from`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/379).

        to have the same subject (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/399,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/403).
      - x509_certificate - for the ``ownca`` provider, check whether the CA private
        key actually belongs to the CA certificate (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407).
      - x509_certificate - regenerate certificate when the CA's public key changes
        for ``provider=ownca`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407).
      - x509_certificate - regenerate certificate when the CA's subject changes for
        ``provider=ownca`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/400,

  2.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make collection more robust when PyOpenSSL is used with an incompatible cryptography
        version (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/445).
      - x509_crl - fix crash when ``issuer`` for a revoked certificate is specified
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/441).
      minor_changes:
      - Prepare collection for inclusion in an Execution Environment by declaring
        its dependencies. Please note that system packages are used for cryptography
        and PyOpenSSL, which can be rather limited. If you need features from newer
        cryptography versions, you will have to manually force a newer version to
        be installed by pip by specifying something like ``cryptography >= 37.0.0``
        in your Execution Environment's Python dependencies file (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/440).
      - Support automatic conversion for Internalionalized Domain Names (IDNs). When
        passing general names, for example Subject Altenative Names to ``community.crypto.openssl_csr``,
        these will automatically be converted to IDNA. Conversion will be done per
        label to IDNA2008 if possible, and IDNA2003 if IDNA2008 conversion fails for
        that label. Note that IDNA conversion requires `the Python idna library <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_
        to be installed. Please note that depending on which versions of the cryptography
        library are used, it could try to process the converted IDNA another time
        with the Python ``idna`` library and reject IDNA2003 encoded values. Using
        a new enough ``cryptography`` version avoids this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/426,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
      - acme_* modules - add parameter ``request_timeout`` to manage HTTP(S) request
        timeout (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/447,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/448).
      - luks_devices - added ``perf_same_cpu_crypt``, ``perf_submit_from_crypt_cpus``,
        ``perf_no_read_workqueue``, ``perf_no_write_workqueue`` for performance tuning
        when opening LUKS2 containers (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/427).
      - luks_devices - added ``persistent`` option when opening LUKS2 containers (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/434).
      - openssl_csr_info - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding (IDNA,
        Unicode) used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
      - openssl_pkcs12 - allow to provide the private key as text instead of having
        to read it from a file. This allows to store the private key in an encrypted
        form, for example in Ansible Vault (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/452).
      - x509_certificate_info - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding
        (IDNA, Unicode) used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
      - x509_crl - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding (IDNA, Unicode)
        used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
      - x509_crl_info - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding (IDNA,
