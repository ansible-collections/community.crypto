  1.0.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - 'ACME modules: fix bug in ACME v1 account update code'
        - 'ACME modules: make sure some connection errors are handled properly'
        - 'ACME modules: support Buypass'' ACME v1 endpoint'
        - acme_certificate - fix crash when module is used with Python 2.x.
        - acme_certificate - fix misbehavior when ACME v1 is used with ``modify_account``
          set to ``false``.
        - 'ecs_certificate - Always specify header ``connection: keep-alive`` for
          ECS API connections.'
        - ecs_certificate - Fix formatting of contents of ``full_chain_path``.
        - get_certificate - Fix cryptography backend when pyopenssl is unavailable
          (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67900)
        - openssh_keypair - add logic to avoid breaking password protected keys.
        - openssh_keypair - fixes idempotence issue with public key (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64969).
        - openssh_keypair - public key's file attributes (permissions, owner, group,
          etc.) are now set to the same values as the private key.
        - openssl_* modules - prevent crash on fingerprint determination in FIPS mode
          (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67213).
        - 'openssl_certificate - When provider is ``entrust``, use a ``connection:
          keep-alive`` header for ECS API connections.'
        - openssl_certificate - ``provider`` option was documented as required, but
          it was not checked whether it was provided. It is now only required when
          ``state`` is ``present``.
        - openssl_certificate - fix ``assertonly`` provider certificate verification,
          causing 'private key mismatch' and 'subject mismatch' errors.
        - openssl_certificate and openssl_csr - fix Ed25519 and Ed448 private key
          support for ``cryptography`` backend. This probably needs at least cryptography
          2.8, since older versions have problems with signing certificates or CSRs
          with such keys. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59039, PR https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/63984)
        - openssl_csr - a warning is issued if an unsupported value for ``version``
          is used for the ``cryptography`` backend.
        - openssl_csr - the module will now enforce that ``privatekey_path`` is specified
          when ``state=present``.
        - openssl_publickey - fix a module crash caused when pyOpenSSL is not installed
          (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67035).
      deprecated_features:
        - openssl_csr - all values for the ``version`` option except ``1`` are deprecated.
          The value 1 denotes the current only standardized CSR version.
      minor_changes:
        - luks_device - accept ``passphrase``, ``new_passphrase`` and ``remove_passphrase``.
        - luks_device - add ``keysize`` parameter to set key size at LUKS container
          creation
        - luks_device - added support to use UUIDs, and labels with LUKS2 containers
        - luks_device - added the ``type`` option that allows user explicit define
          the LUKS container format version
        - openssh_keypair - instead of regenerating some broken or password protected
          keys, fail the module. Keys can still be regenerated by calling the module
          with ``force=yes``.
        - openssh_keypair - the ``regenerate`` option allows to configure the module's
          behavior when it should or needs to regenerate private keys.
        - openssl_* modules - the cryptography backend now properly supports ``dirName``,
          ``otherName`` and ``RID`` (Registered ID) names.
        - openssl_certificate - Add option for changing which ACME directory to use
          with acme-tiny. Set the default ACME directory to Let's Encrypt instead
          of using acme-tiny's default. (acme-tiny also uses Let's Encrypt at the
          time being, so no action should be necessary.)
        - openssl_certificate - Change the required version of acme-tiny to >= 4.0.0
        - openssl_certificate - allow to provide content of some input files via the
          ``csr_content``, ``privatekey_content``, ``ownca_privatekey_content`` and
          ``ownca_content`` options.
        - openssl_certificate - allow to return the existing/generated certificate
          directly as ``certificate`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
        - openssl_certificate_info - allow to provide certificate content via ``content``
          option (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64776).
        - openssl_csr - Add support for specifying the SAN ``otherName`` value in
          the OpenSSL ASN.1 UTF8 string format, ``otherName:<OID>;UTF8:string value``.
        - openssl_csr - allow to provide private key content via ``private_key_content``
          option.
        - openssl_csr - allow to return the existing/generated CSR directly as ``csr``
          by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
        - openssl_csr_info - allow to provide CSR content via ``content`` option.
        - openssl_dhparam - allow to return the existing/generated DH params directly
          as ``dhparams`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
        - openssl_dhparam - now supports a ``cryptography``-based backend. Auto-detection
          can be overwritten with the ``select_crypto_backend`` option.
        - openssl_pkcs12 - allow to return the existing/generated PKCS#12 directly
          as ``pkcs12`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
        - openssl_privatekey - add ``format`` and ``format_mismatch`` options.
        - openssl_privatekey - allow to return the existing/generated private key
          directly as ``privatekey`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
        - openssl_privatekey - the ``regenerate`` option allows to configure the module's
          behavior when it should or needs to regenerate private keys.
        - openssl_privatekey_info - allow to provide private key content via ``content``
          option.
        - openssl_publickey - allow to provide private key content via ``private_key_content``
          option.
        - openssl_publickey - allow to return the existing/generated public key directly
          as ``publickey`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.

      release_summary: Please note that this release fixes a security issue (CVE-2020-25646).
      security_fixes:
        - openssl_csr - the option ``privatekey_content`` was not marked as ``no_log``,
          resulting in it being dumped into the system log by default, and returned
          in the registered results in the ``invocation`` field (CVE-2020-25646, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/125).
        - openssl_privatekey_info - the option ``content`` was not marked as ``no_log``,
          resulting in it being dumped into the system log by default, and returned
          in the registered results in the ``invocation`` field (CVE-2020-25646, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/125).

  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - openssl_pkcs12 - report the correct state when ``action`` is ``parse`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/143).
        - support code - improve handling of certificate and certificate signing request
          (CSR) loading with the ``cryptography`` backend when errors occur (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/138,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/139).
        - x509_certificate - fix ``entrust`` provider, which was broken since community.crypto
          0.1.0 due to a feature added before the collection move (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).
      minor_changes:
        - openssh_cert - add module parameter ``use_agent`` to enable using signing
          keys stored in ssh-agent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/116).
        - openssl_csr - refactor module to allow code reuse by openssl_csr_pipe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/123).
        - openssl_privatekey - refactor module to allow code reuse by openssl_privatekey_pipe
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/119).
        - openssl_privatekey - the elliptic curve ``secp192r1`` now triggers a security
          warning. Elliptic curves of at least 224 bits should be used for new keys;
          see `here <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/ec.html#elliptic-curves>`_
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/132).
        - x509_certificate - for the ``selfsigned`` provider, a CSR is not required
          anymore. If no CSR is provided, the module behaves as if a minimal CSR which
          only contains the public key has been provided (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/32,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/129).
        - x509_certificate - refactor module to allow code reuse by x509_certificate_pipe
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).
      release_summary: 'Contains new modules ``openssl_privatekey_pipe``, ``openssl_csr_pipe``
        and ``x509_certificate_pipe`` which allow to create or update private keys,
        CSRs and X.509 certificates without having to write them to disk.

  1.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - acme_certificate - error when requested challenge type is not found for
          non-valid challenges, instead of hanging on step 2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/171,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/173).
      minor_changes:
        - The ACME module_utils has been relicensed back from the Simplified BSD License
          (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) to the GPLv3+ (same license
          used by most other code in this collection). This undoes a licensing change
          when the original GPLv3+ licensed code was moved to module_utils in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40697
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/165).
        - The ``crypto/identify.py`` module_utils has been renamed to ``crypto/pem.py``
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).
        - luks_device - ``new_keyfile``, ``new_passphrase``, ``remove_keyfile`` and
          ``remove_passphrase`` are now idempotent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/19,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/168).
        - luks_device - allow to configure PBKDF (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/163).
        - openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - allow to specify CRL distribution endpoints
          with ``crl_distribution_points`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/147,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/167).
        - openssl_pkcs12 - allow to specify certificate bundles in ``other_certificates``
          by using new option ``other_certificates_parse_all`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/149,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).

  1.5.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - openssl_csr - no longer fails when comparing CSR without basic constraint
          when ``basic_constraints`` is specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/179,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/180).
      deprecated_features:
        - acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders=url_list``, ``orders`` will no
          longer be returned in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use ``order_uris`` instead
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178).
      minor_changes:
        - acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders`` is not ``ignore`` and the ACME
          server allows to query orders, the new return value ``order_uris`` is always
          populated with a list of URIs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178).
        - luks_device - allow to specify sector size for LUKS2 containers with new
          ``sector_size`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/193).
      release_summary: Regular feature and bugfix release. Deprecates a return value.

          is deprecated and will be removed in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use the new
          Python modules in the ``acme`` package instead (``ansible_collections.community.crypto.plugins.module_utils.acme.xxx``)
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
      minor_changes:
        - acme module_utils - the ``acme`` module_utils has been split up into several
          Python modules (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
        - acme_* modules - codebase refactor which should not be visible to end-users
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/184).
        - acme_* modules - support account key passphrases for ``cryptography`` backend
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/197, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).
        - acme_certificate_revoke - support revoking by private keys that are passphrase
          protected for ``cryptography`` backend (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/207).

          keypairs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/113,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/230).
        - various modules - prevent crashes when modules try to set attributes on
          not yet existing files in check mode. This will be fixed in ansible-core
          2.12, but it is not backported to every Ansible version we support (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issue/242,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/243).
        - x509_certificate - fix crash when ``assertonly`` provider is used and some
          error conditions should be reported (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/240,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/241).
      minor_changes:
        - cryptography_openssh module utils - new module_utils for managing asymmetric
          keypairs and OpenSSH formatted/encoded asymmetric keypairs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/213).
        - openssh_keypair - added ``backend`` parameter for selecting between the
          cryptography library or the OpenSSH binary for the execution of actions
          performed by ``openssh_keypair`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/236).
        - openssh_keypair - added ``passphrase`` parameter for encrypting/decrypting
          OpenSSH private keys (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/225).

          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/150).
        - openssl_pkcs12 - added option ``select_crypto_backend`` and a ``cryptography``
          backend. This requires cryptography 3.0 or newer, and does not support the
          ``iter_size`` and ``maciter_size`` options (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/234).
        - openssl_privatekey - add diff mode (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/38,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/150).

        - openssh certificate module utils - new module_utils for parsing OpenSSH
          certificates (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/246).
        - openssh_cert - added ``regenerate`` option to validate additional certificate

        - keypair_backend module utils - simplify code to pass sanity tests (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/263).
        - openssh_keypair - fixed ``cryptography`` backend to preserve original file
          permissions when regenerating a keypair requires existing files to be overwritten
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/260).
        - openssh_keypair - fixed error handling to restore original keypair if regeneration

          on CSRs and certificates from stdin to use ``/dev/stdin`` instead of ``-``.
          This is needed for OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, apparently (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/279).
        - acme_challenge_cert_helper - only return exception when cryptography is
          not installed, not when a too old version of it is installed. This prevents
          Ansible's callback to crash (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/281).

  2.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - Adjust ``dirName`` text parsing and to text converting code to conform to
          `Sections 2 and 3 of RFC 4514 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4514.html>`_.
          This is similar to how `cryptography handles this <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/x509/reference/#cryptography.x509.Name.rfc4514_string>`_
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/274).
        - acme module utils - removing compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/290).
        - acme_* modules - removed vendored copy of the Python library ``ipaddress``.
          If you are using Python 2.x, please make sure to install the library (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/287).
        - compatibility module_utils - removed vendored copy of the Python library
          ``ipaddress`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/287).
        - crypto module utils - removing compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/290).
        - get_certificate, openssl_csr_info, x509_certificate_info - depending on
          the ``cryptography`` version used, the modules might not return the ASN.1
          value for an extension as contained in the certificate respectively CSR,
          but a re-encoded version of it. This should usually be identical to the
          value contained in the source file, unless the value was malformed. For
          extensions not handled by C(cryptography) the value contained in the source
          file is always returned unaltered (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/318).
        - module_utils - removed various PyOpenSSL support functions and default backend
          values that are not needed for the openssl_pkcs12 module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/273).
        - openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe, x509_crl - the ``subject`` respectively ``issuer``
          fields no longer ignore empty values, but instead fail when encountering
          them (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
        - openssl_privatekey_info - by default consistency checks are not run; they
          need to be explicitly requested by passing ``check_consistency=true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/309).
        - x509_crl - for idempotency checks, the ``issuer`` order is ignored. If order
          is important, use the new ``issuer_ordered`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
      bugfixes:
        - cryptography backend - improve Unicode handling for Python 2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/313).
        - get_certificate - fix compatibility with the cryptography 35.0.0 release
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/294).
        - openssl_csr_info - fix compatibility with the cryptography 35.0.0 release
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/294).
        - openssl_pkcs12 - fix compatibility with the cryptography 35.0.0 release
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/296).
        - x509_certificate_info - fix compatibility with the cryptography 35.0.0 release
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/294).
      deprecated_features:
        - acme_* modules - ACME version 1 is now deprecated and support for it will
          be removed in community.crypto 2.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/288).
      minor_changes:
        - acme_certificate - the ``subject`` and ``issuer`` fields in in the ``select_chain``
          entries are now more strictly validated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
        - openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - provide a new ``subject_ordered`` option
          if the order of the components in the subject is of importance (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/291,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
        - openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - there is now stricter validation of the
          values of the ``subject`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
        - openssl_privatekey_info - add ``check_consistency`` option to request private
          key consistency checks to be done (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/309).
        - x509_certificate, x509_certificate_pipe - add ``ignore_timestamps`` option
          which allows to enable idempotency for 'not before' and 'not after' options
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/295, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/317).
        - x509_crl - provide a new ``issuer_ordered`` option if the order of the components
          in the issuer is of importance (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/291,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
        - x509_crl - there is now stricter validation of the values of the ``issuer``
          option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
      release_summary: 'A new major release of the ``community.crypto`` collection.
        The main changes are removal of the PyOpenSSL backends for almost all modules
        (``openssl_pkcs12`` being the only exception), and removal of the ``assertonly``
        provider in the ``x509_certificate`` provider. There are also some other breaking
        changes which should improve the user interface/experience of this collection
        long-term.

  2.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - acme_certificate - avoid passing multiple certificates to ``cryptography``'s
          X.509 certificate loader when ``fullchain_dest`` is used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/324).
        - get_certificate, openssl_csr_info, x509_certificate_info - add fallback
          code for extension parsing that works with cryptography 36.0.0 and newer.
          This code re-serializes de-serialized extensions and thus can return slightly
          different values if the extension in the original CSR resp. certificate
          was not canonicalized correctly. This code is currently used as a fallback
          if the existing code stops working, but we will switch it to be the main
          code in a future release (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/331).
        - luks_device - now also runs a built-in LUKS signature cleaner on ``state=absent``
          to make sure that also the secondary LUKS2 header is wiped when older versions
          of wipefs are used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/326,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/327).
        - openssl_pkcs12 - use new PKCS#12 deserialization infrastructure from cryptography
          36.0.0 if available (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/302).
      minor_changes:
        - acme_* modules - fix usage of ``fetch_url`` with changes in latest ansible-core
          ``devel`` branch (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/339).

          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/403).
        - x509_certificate - for the ``ownca`` provider, check whether the CA private
          key actually belongs to the CA certificate (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407).
        - x509_certificate - regenerate certificate when the CA's public key changes

  2.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Make collection more robust when PyOpenSSL is used with an incompatible
          cryptography version (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/445).
        - x509_crl - fix crash when ``issuer`` for a revoked certificate is specified
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/441).
      minor_changes:
        - Prepare collection for inclusion in an Execution Environment by declaring
          its dependencies. Please note that system packages are used for cryptography
          and PyOpenSSL, which can be rather limited. If you need features from newer
          cryptography versions, you will have to manually force a newer version to
          be installed by pip by specifying something like ``cryptography >= 37.0.0``
          in your Execution Environment's Python dependencies file (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/440).
        - Support automatic conversion for Internalionalized Domain Names (IDNs).
          When passing general names, for example Subject Alternative Names to ``community.crypto.openssl_csr``,
          these will automatically be converted to IDNA. Conversion will be done per
          label to IDNA2008 if possible, and IDNA2003 if IDNA2008 conversion fails
          for that label. Note that IDNA conversion requires `the Python idna library
          <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_ to be installed. Please note that depending
          on which versions of the cryptography library are used, it could try to
          process the converted IDNA another time with the Python ``idna`` library
          and reject IDNA2003 encoded values. Using a new enough ``cryptography``
          version avoids this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/426,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
        - acme_* modules - add parameter ``request_timeout`` to manage HTTP(S) request
          timeout (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/447,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/448).
        - luks_devices - added ``perf_same_cpu_crypt``, ``perf_submit_from_crypt_cpus``,
          ``perf_no_read_workqueue``, ``perf_no_write_workqueue`` for performance
          tuning when opening LUKS2 containers (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/427).
        - luks_devices - added ``persistent`` option when opening LUKS2 containers
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/434).
        - openssl_csr_info - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding
          (IDNA, Unicode) used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
        - openssl_pkcs12 - allow to provide the private key as text instead of having
          to read it from a file. This allows to store the private key in an encrypted
          form, for example in Ansible Vault (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/452).
        - x509_certificate_info - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding
          (IDNA, Unicode) used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
        - x509_crl - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding (IDNA, Unicode)
          used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
        - x509_crl_info - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding (IDNA,

          an existing key, contradicting the documentation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/598).

        tool

        from ansible-core before 2.15, please note that it does not render the markup

        correctly. You should be still able to read it in most cases, but you need

        ansible-core 2.15 or later to see it as it is intended. Alternatively you

        - acme_* modules - increase number of retries from 5 to 10 to increase stability
          with unstable ACME endpoints (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/685).
        - acme_* modules - make account registration handling more flexible to accept
          404 instead of 400 send by DigiCert's ACME endpoint when an account does

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - openssl_dhparam - was using an internal function instead of the public API
          to load DH param files when using the ``cryptography`` backend. The internal
          function was removed in cryptography 42.0.0. The module now uses the public
          API, which has been available since support for DH params was added to cryptography
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/698).
        - openssl_privatekey_info - ``check_consistency=true`` no longer works for
          RSA keys with cryptography 42.0.0+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/701).
        - openssl_privatekey_info - ``check_consistency=true`` now reports a warning
          if it cannot determine consistency (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/705).

  2.18.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - luks_device - fixed module a bug that prevented using ``remove_keyslot``
          with the value ``0`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/710).
        - luks_device - fixed module falsely outputting ``changed=false`` when trying
          to add a new slot with a key that is already present in another slot. The
          module now rejects adding keys that are already present in another slot
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/710).
        - luks_device - fixed testing of LUKS passphrases in when specifying a keyslot
          for cryptsetup version 2.0.3. The output of this cryptsetup version slightly
          differs from later versions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/710).
      deprecated_features:
        - 'openssl_csr_pipe, openssl_privatekey_pipe, x509_certificate_pipe - the
          current behavior of check mode is deprecated and will change in community.crypto
          3.0.0. The current behavior is similar to the modules without ``_pipe``:
          if the object needs to be (re-)generated, only the ``changed`` status is
          set, but the object is not updated. From community.crypto 3.0.0 on, the
          modules will ignore check mode and always act as if check mode is not active.
          This behavior can already achieved now by adding ``check_mode: false`` to
          the task. If you think this breaks your use-case of this module, please
          `create an issue in the community.crypto repository <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/new/choose>`__
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/712, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/714).'
      minor_changes:
        - x509_crl - the new option ``serial_numbers`` allow to configure in which
          format serial numbers can be provided to ``revoked_certificates[].serial_number``.
          The default is as integers (``serial_numbers=integer``) for backwards compatibility;
          setting ``serial_numbers=hex-octets`` allows to specify colon-separated
          hex octet strings like ``00:11:22:FF`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/687,

          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/725).
      deprecated_features:
        - acme.backends module utils - from community.crypto on, all implementations
          of ``CryptoBackend`` must override ``get_ordered_csr_identifiers()``. The
          current default implementation, which simply sorts the result of ``get_csr_identifiers()``,
          will then be removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/725).
      minor_changes:
        - When using cryptography >= 42.0.0, use offset-aware ``datetime.datetime``
          objects (with timezone UTC) instead of offset-naive UTC timestamps (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/726,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/727).

          a specific certificate according to the Renewal Information specification
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/740).

          timestamps which omitted the second count, the first digit of the minutes
          was used as a one-digit minutes count, and the second digit of the minutes
          as a one-digit second count (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/745).

        - acme documentation fragment - the default ``community.crypto.acme[.documentation]``
          docs fragment is deprecated and will be removed from community.crypto 3.0.0.
          Replace it with both the new ``community.crypto.acme.basic`` and ``community.crypto.acme.account``
          fragments (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/735).
        - acme.backends module utils - the ``get_cert_information()`` method for a
          ACME crypto backend must be implemented from community.crypto 3.0.0 on (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/736).
        - crypto.module_backends.common module utils - the ``crypto.module_backends.common``
          module utils is deprecated and will be removed from community.crypto 3.0.0.
          Use the improved ``argspec`` module util instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/749).
      minor_changes:
        - acme_certificate - add ``include_renewal_cert_id`` option to allow requesting
          renewal of a specific certificate according to the current ACME Renewal
          Information specification draft (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/739).

    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - certificate_complete_chain - add ability to identify Ed25519 and Ed448 complete
          chains (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/777).

  2.21.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - When using cryptography >= 43.0.0, use offset-aware ``datetime.datetime``
          objects (with timezone UTC) instead of offset-naive UTC timestamps for the
          ``InvalidityDate`` X.509 CRL extension (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/726,

    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - openssl_privatekey, openssl_privatekey_pipe - add default value ``auto``
          for ``cipher`` option, which happens to be the only supported value for
          this option anyway. Therefore it is no longer necessary to specify ``cipher=auto``
          when providing ``passphrase`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/793,

        - acme_* modules - when querying renewal information, make sure to insert
          a slash between the base URL and the certificate identifier (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/801,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/802).
        - various modules - pass absolute paths to ``module.atomic_move()`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83950,

  2.22.3:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - acme_* modules - when using the OpenSSL backend, explicitly use the UTC
          timezone in Python code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/811).
        - time module utils - fix conversion of naive ``datetime`` objects to UNIX
          timestamps for Python 3 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/808,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/810).

  2.23.0:
    changes:
      deprecated_features:
        - openssl_pkcs12 - the PyOpenSSL based backend is deprecated and will be removed
          from community.crypto 3.0.0. From that point on you need cryptography 3.0
          or newer to use this module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/667,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/831).
      minor_changes:
        - acme_certificate - add compatibility for ACME CAs that are not fully RFC8555
          compliant and do not provide ``challenges`` in authz objects (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/824,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/832).
        - luks_device - allow to provide passphrases base64-encoded (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/827,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/829).
        - x509_certificate_convert - add new option ``verify_cert_parsable`` which
          allows to check whether the certificate can actually be parsed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/809,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/830).

    release_date: '2024-12-30'
  2.24.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - crypto_info - when running the module on Fedora 41 with ``cryptography``
          installed from the package repository, the module crashed apparently due
          to some elliptic curves being removed from libssl against which cryptography
          is running, which cryptography did not expect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/834).
      deprecated_features:
        - Support for ansible-core 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, and 2.16 is deprecated,
          and will be removed in the next major release (community.crypto 3.0.0).
          Some modules might still work with some of these versions afterwards, but
          we will no longer keep compatibility code that was needed to support them.
          Note that this means that support for all Python versions before 3.7 will
          be dropped, also on the target side (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/559,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/839).
        - Support for cryptography < 3.4 is deprecated, and will be removed in the
          next major release (community.crypto 3.0.0). Some modules might still work
          with older versions of cryptography, but we will no longer keep compatibility
          code that was needed to support them (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/559,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/839).
      minor_changes:
        - acme_certificate - add options ``order_creation_error_strategy`` and ``order_creation_max_retries``
          which allow to configure the error handling behavior if creating a new ACME
          order fails. This is particularly important when using the ``include_renewal_cert_id``
          option, and the default value ``auto`` for ``order_creation_error_strategy``
          tries to gracefully handle related errors (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/842).
        - acme_certificate - allow to chose a profile for certificate generation,
          in case the CA supports this using Internet-Draft `draft-aaron-acme-profiles
          <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aaron-acme-profiles/>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/835).
        - acme_certificate_renewal_info - add ``exists`` and ``parsable`` return values
          and ``treat_parsing_error_as_non_existing`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/838).
      release_summary: New feature and bugfix release with multiple new modules. It
        also deprecates support for older ansible-core and Python versions.

          for cases where the data already exists in memory and not yet in a file
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/847, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/848).

    changes:

        - luks_device - mark parameter ``passphrase_encoding`` as ``no_log=False``
          to avoid confusing warning (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/867).
        - luks_device - removing a specific keyslot with ``remove_keyslot`` caused
          the module to hang while cryptsetup was waiting for a passphrase from stdin,
          while the module did not supply one. Since a keyslot is not necessary, do
          not provide one (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/864,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/868).
