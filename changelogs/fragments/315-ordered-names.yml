  - "openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - provide a new ``subject_ordered`` option if the order of the components in the subject is of importance (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/291, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316)."
  - "x509_crl - there is now stricter validation of the values of the ``issuer`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316)."

breaking_changes:
  - "openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe, x509_crl - the ``subject`` respectively ``issuer`` fields no longer ignore empty values, but instead fail when encountering them (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316)."
