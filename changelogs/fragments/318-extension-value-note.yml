  - "get_certificate, openssl_csr_info, x509_certificate_info - depending on the ``cryptography`` version used,
     the modules might not return the ASN.1 value for an extension as contained in the certificate respectively CSR,
     but a re-encoded version of it. This should usually be identical to the value contained in the source file,
     unless the value was malformed. For extensions not handled by C(cryptography) always the value contained in
     the source file is returned (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/318)."
