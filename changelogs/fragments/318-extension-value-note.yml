  - "get_certificate, openssl_csr_info, x509_certificate_info - depending on the ``cryptography`` version used,
     the modules might not return the ASN.1 value for an extension as contained in the certificate respectively CSR,
     but a re-encoded version of it. This should usually be identical to the value contained in the source file,
     unless the value was malformed. For extensions not handled by C(cryptography) the value contained in
     the source file is always returned unaltered (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/318)."
