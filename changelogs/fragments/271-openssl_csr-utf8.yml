bugfixes:
- "openssl_csr and openssl_csr_pipe - make sure that Unicode strings are used to compare strings with the cryptography backend. This fixes idempotency problems with non-ASCII letters on Python 2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/270, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/271)."
