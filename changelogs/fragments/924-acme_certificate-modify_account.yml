deprecated_features:
  - "acme_certificate - the option ``modify_account``'s default value ``true`` has been deprecated. It will change to ``false`` in community.crypto 4.0.0.
     We recommend to set the option to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings, and to prefer setting it to ``false`` already now.
     Better use the ``community.crypto.acme_account`` module instead
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/924)."
