minor_changes:
- "The ACME module_utils has been relicensed back from the Simplified BSD License (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) to the GPLv3+ (same license used by most other code in this collection). This undoes a licensing change when the original GPLv3+ licensed code was moved to module_utils in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40697 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/165)."
