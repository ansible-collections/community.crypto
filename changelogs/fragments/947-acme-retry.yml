bugfixes:
  - "acme_* modules - also retry on HTTP responses 502 Bad Gateway and 504 Gateway Timeout. The latter is needed for ZeroSSL,
     which seems to have a lot of 504s
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/945, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/947)."
