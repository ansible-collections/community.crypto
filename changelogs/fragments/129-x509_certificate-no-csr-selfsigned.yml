minor_changes:
- "x509_certificate - for the ``selfsigned`` provider, a CSR is not required anymore. If no CSR is provided, the module behaves as if a minimal CSR which only contains the public key has been provided (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/32, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/129)."
