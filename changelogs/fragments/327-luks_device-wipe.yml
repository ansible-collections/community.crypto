bugfixes:
  - "luks_device - now also runs a built-in LUKS signature cleaner on ``state=absent`` to make sure that also the secondary LUKS2 header is wiped when older versions of wipefs are used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/326, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/327)."
