minor_changes:
  - "x509_certificate, x509_certificate_pipe - add ``regenerate`` option to allow better control on when certificates should be regenerated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/295, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/310)."
breaking_changes:
  - "x509_certificate, x509_certificate_pipe - by default, broken certificates will now cause the module to fail instead of them being regenerated. This can be changed with the ``regenerate`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/310)."
