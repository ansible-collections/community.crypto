  - "Prepare collection for inclusion in an Execution Environment by declaring its dependencies.
     Please note that system packages are used for cryptography and PyOpenSSL, which can be
     rather limited. If you need features from newer cryptography versions, you will have to
     manually force a newer version to be installed by pip by specifying something like
     ``cryptography >= 37.0.0`` in your Execution Environment's Python dependencies file
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/440)."
