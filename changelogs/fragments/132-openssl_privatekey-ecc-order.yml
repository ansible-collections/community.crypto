minor_changes:
- "openssl_privatekey - the elliptic curve ``secp192r1`` now triggers a security warning. Elliptic curves of at least 224 bits should be used for new keys; see `here <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/ec.html#elliptic-curves>`_ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/132)."
