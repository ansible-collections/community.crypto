bugfixes:
  - "luks_device - removing a specific keyslot with ``remove_keyslot`` caused the module to hang while cryptsetup was waiting for a passphrase from stdin,
     while the module did not supply one. Since a keyslot is not necessary, do not provide one
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/864, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/868)."
