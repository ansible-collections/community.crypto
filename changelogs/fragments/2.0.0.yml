release_summary: >
  A new major release of the ``community.crypto`` collection.
  The main changes are removal of the PyOpenSSL backends for almost all modules (``openssl_pkcs12`` being the only exception),
  and removal of the ``assertonly`` provider in the ``x509_certificate`` provider.
  There are also some other breaking changes which should improve the user interface/experience of this collection long-term.
