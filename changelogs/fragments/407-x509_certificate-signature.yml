bugfixes:
  - "x509_certificate - for the ``ownca`` provider, check whether the CA private key actually belongs to the CA certificate. This fix only covers the ``cryptography`` backend, not the ``pyopenssl`` backend (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407)."
  - "x509_certificate - regenerate certificate when the CA's public key changes for ``provider=ownca``. This fix only covers the ``cryptography`` backend, not the ``pyopenssl`` backend (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407)."
  - "x509_certificate - regenerate certificate when the private key changes for ``provider=selfsigned``. This fix only covers the ``cryptography`` backend, not the ``pyopenssl`` backend (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407)."
known_issues:
  - "x509_certificate - when using the ``ownca`` provider with the ``pyopenssl`` backend, it is possible to specify a CA private key which is not related to the CA certificate (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407)."
  - "x509_certificate - when using the ``ownca`` provider with the ``pyopenssl`` backend, changing the CA's public key does not cause regeneration of the certificate (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407)."
  - "x509_certificate - when using the ``selfsigned`` provider with the ``pyopenssl`` backend, changing the private key does not cause regeneration of the certificate (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407)."
