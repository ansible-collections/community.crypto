bugfixes:
  - "crypto_info - when running the module on Fedora 41 with ``cryptography`` installed from the package repository,
     the module crashed apparently due to some elliptic curves being removed from libssl against which cryptography
     is running, which cryptography did not expect
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/834)."
