bugfixes:
  - "Improve error message when loading a private key fails due to correct private key files or wrong passwords.
     Also include the original cryptography error since it likely contains more helpful information
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/936, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/939)."
