minor_changes:
- "acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders`` is not ``ignore`` and the ACME server allows to query orders, the new return value ``order_uris`` is always populated with a list of URIs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178)."
deprecated_features:
- "acme_account_info - when ``retrieve_orders=url_list``, ``orders`` will no longer be returned in community.crypto 2.0.0. Use ``order_uris`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/178)."
