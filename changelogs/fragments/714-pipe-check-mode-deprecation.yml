deprecated_features:
  - "openssl_csr_pipe, openssl_privatekey_pipe, x509_certificate_pipe - the current behavior of check mode is deprecated and will change in community.crypto 3.0.0.
    The current behavior is similar to the modules without ``_pipe``: if the object needs to be (re-)generated, only the ``changed`` status is set, but the object
    is not updated. From community.crypto 3.0.0 on, the modules will ignore check mode and always act as if check mode is not active. This behavior can already
    achieved now by adding ``check_mode: false`` to the task. If you think this breaks your use-case of this module, please
    `create an issue in the community.crypto repository <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/new/choose>`__
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/712, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/714)."
