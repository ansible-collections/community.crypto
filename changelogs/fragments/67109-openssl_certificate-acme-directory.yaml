minor_changes:
  - "openssl_certificate - Add option for changing which ACME directory to use with acme-tiny. Set the default ACME directory to Let's Encrypt instead of using acme-tiny's default. (acme-tiny also uses Let's Encrypt at the time being, so no action should be neccessary.)"
  - "openssl_certificate - Change the required version of acme-tiny to >= 4.0.0"
