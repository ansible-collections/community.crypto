bugfixes:
  - "x509_certificate - since community.crypto 2.19.0 the module was no longer idempotent with respect to ``not_before`` and ``not_after`` times.
     This is now fixed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/753, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/754)."
