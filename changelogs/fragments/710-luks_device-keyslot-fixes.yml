bugfixes:
  - "luks_device - fixed module a bug that prevented using ``remove_keyslot`` with the value ``0`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/710)."
  - "luks_device - fixed module falsely outputting ``changed=false`` when trying to add a new slot with a key that is already present in another slot. The module now rejects adding keys that are already present in another slot (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/710)."
  - "luks_device - fixed testing of LUKS passphrases in when specifying a keyslot for cryptsetup version 2.0.3. The output of this cryptsetup version slightly differs from later versions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/710)."
