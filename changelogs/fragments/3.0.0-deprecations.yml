deprecated_features:
  - "Support for ansible-core 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, and 2.16 is deprecated,
     and will be removed in the next major release (community.crypto 3.0.0).
     Some modules might still work with some of these versions afterwards,
     but we will no longer keep compatibility code that was needed to support them.
     Note that this means that support for all Python versions before 3.7 will be dropped,
     also on the target side
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/559,
      https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/839)."
  - "Support for cryptography < 3.4 is deprecated,
     and will be removed in the next major release (community.crypto 3.0.0).
     Some modules might still work with older versions of cryptography,
     but we will no longer keep compatibility code that was needed to support them
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/559,
      https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/839)."
