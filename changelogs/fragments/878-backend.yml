minor_changes:
  - "No longer provide cryptography's ``backend`` parameter. This will break with cryptography < 3.1 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/878)."
  - "Remove various compatibility code for cryptography < 3.4 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/878)."
  - "On cryptography 36.0.0+, always use ``public_bytes()`` for X.509 extension objects instead of using cryptography internals to obtain DER value of extension (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/878)."
removed_features:
  - "crypto.basic module utils - remove ``CRYPTOGRAPHY_HAS_*`` flags. All tested features are supported since cryptography 3.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/878)."
  - "crypto.cryptography_support module utils - remove ``cryptography_serial_number_of_cert()`` helper function (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/878)."
  - "The collection no longer supports cryptography < 3.4 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/878)."
