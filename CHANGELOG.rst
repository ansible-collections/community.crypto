v2.20.0
=======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature and bugfix release.

The deprecations in this release are only relevant for collections that use shared
code or docs fragments from this collection.

Minor Changes
-------------

- acme_certificate - add ``include_renewal_cert_id`` option to allow requesting renewal of a specific certificate according to the current ACME Renewal Information specification draft (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/739).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- acme documentation fragment - the default ``community.crypto.acme[.documentation]`` docs fragment is deprecated and will be removed from community.crypto 3.0.0. Replace it with both the new ``community.crypto.acme.basic`` and ``community.crypto.acme.account`` fragments (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/735).
- acme.backends module utils - the ``get_cert_information()`` method for a ACME crypto backend must be implemented from community.crypto 3.0.0 on (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/736).
- crypto.module_backends.common module utils - the ``crypto.module_backends.common`` module utils is deprecated and will be removed from community.crypto 3.0.0. Use the improved ``argspec`` module util instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/749).

Bugfixes
--------

- x509_crl, x509_certificate, x509_certificate_info - when parsing absolute timestamps which omitted the second count, the first digit of the minutes was used as a one-digit minutes count, and the second digit of the minutes as a one-digit second count (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/745).

New Modules
-----------

- community.crypto.acme_ari_info - Retrieves ACME Renewal Information (ARI) for a certificate.
- community.crypto.acme_certificate_deactivate_authz - Deactivate all authz for an ACME v2 order.
- community.crypto.acme_certificate_renewal_info - Determine whether a certificate should be renewed or not.

v2.19.1
=======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- crypto.math module utils - change return values for ``quick_is_not_prime()`` and ``convert_int_to_bytes(0, 0)`` for special cases that do not appear when using the collection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/733).
- ecs_certificate - fixed ``csr`` option to be empty and allow renewal of a specific certificate according to the Renewal Information specification (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/740).
- x509_certificate - since community.crypto 2.19.0 the module was no longer idempotent with respect to ``not_before`` and ``not_after`` times. This is now fixed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/753, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/754).

v2.19.0
=======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix and feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- When using cryptography >= 42.0.0, use offset-aware ``datetime.datetime`` objects (with timezone UTC) instead of offset-naive UTC timestamps (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/726, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/727).
- openssh_cert - avoid UTC functions deprecated in Python 3.12 when using Python 3 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/727).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- acme.backends module utils - from community.crypto on, all implementations of ``CryptoBackend`` must override ``get_ordered_csr_identifiers()``. The current default implementation, which simply sorts the result of ``get_csr_identifiers()``, will then be removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/725).

Bugfixes
--------

- acme_certificate - respect the order of the CNAME and SAN identifiers that are passed on when creating an ACME order (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/723, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/725).

New Modules
-----------

- community.crypto.x509_certificate_convert - Convert X.509 certificates

v2.18.0
=======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix and feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- x509_crl - the new option ``serial_numbers`` allow to configure in which format serial numbers can be provided to ``revoked_certificates[].serial_number``. The default is as integers (``serial_numbers=integer``) for backwards compatibility; setting ``serial_numbers=hex-octets`` allows to specify colon-separated hex octet strings like ``00:11:22:FF`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/687, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/715).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- openssl_csr_pipe, openssl_privatekey_pipe, x509_certificate_pipe - the current behavior of check mode is deprecated and will change in community.crypto 3.0.0. The current behavior is similar to the modules without ``_pipe``: if the object needs to be (re-)generated, only the ``changed`` status is set, but the object is not updated. From community.crypto 3.0.0 on, the modules will ignore check mode and always act as if check mode is not active. This behavior can already achieved now by adding ``check_mode: false`` to the task. If you think this breaks your use-case of this module, please `create an issue in the community.crypto repository <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/new/choose>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/712, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/714).

Bugfixes
--------

- luks_device - fixed module a bug that prevented using ``remove_keyslot`` with the value ``0`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/710).
- luks_device - fixed module falsely outputting ``changed=false`` when trying to add a new slot with a key that is already present in another slot. The module now rejects adding keys that are already present in another slot (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/710).
- luks_device - fixed testing of LUKS passphrases in when specifying a keyslot for cryptsetup version 2.0.3. The output of this cryptsetup version slightly differs from later versions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/710).

New Plugins
-----------

Filter
~~~~~~

- community.crypto.parse_serial - Convert a serial number as a colon-separated list of hex numbers to an integer
- community.crypto.to_serial - Convert an integer to a colon-separated list of hex numbers

v2.17.1
=======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release for compatibility with cryptography 42.0.0.

Bugfixes
--------

- openssl_dhparam - was using an internal function instead of the public API to load DH param files when using the ``cryptography`` backend. The internal function was removed in cryptography 42.0.0. The module now uses the public API, which has been available since support for DH params was added to cryptography (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/698).
- openssl_privatekey_info - ``check_consistency=true`` no longer works for RSA keys with cryptography 42.0.0+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/701).
- openssl_privatekey_info - ``check_consistency=true`` now reports a warning if it cannot determine consistency (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/705).

Bugfixes
--------

- openssh_cert, openssh_keypair - the modules ignored return codes of ``ssh`` and ``ssh-keygen`` in some cases (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/645, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/646).

v2.14.1
=======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix and maintenance release with updated documentation.

From this version on, community.crypto is using the new `Ansible semantic markup
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#semantic-markup-within-module-documentation>`__
in its documentation. If you look at documentation with the ansible-doc CLI tool
from ansible-core before 2.15, please note that it does not render the markup
correctly. You should be still able to read it in most cases, but you need
ansible-core 2.15 or later to see it as it is intended. Alternatively you can
look at `the devel docsite <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/crypto/>`__
for the rendered HTML version of the documentation of the latest release.

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix PEM detection/identification to also accept random other lines before the line starting with ``-----BEGIN`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/627, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/628).

Known Issues
------------

- Ansible markup will show up in raw form on ansible-doc text output for ansible-core before 2.15. If you have trouble deciphering the documentation markup, please upgrade to ansible-core 2.15 (or newer), or read the HTML documentation on https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/crypto/.

v2.14.0
=======

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- x509_crl - the ``mode`` option is deprecated; use ``crl_mode`` instead. The ``mode`` option will change its meaning in community.crypto 3.0.0, and will refer to the CRL file's mode instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/596).

Bugfixes
--------

- openssh_keypair - always generate a new key pair if the private key does not exist. Previously, the module would fail when ``regenerate=fail`` without an existing key, contradicting the documentation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/598).
- x509_crl - remove problem with ansible-core 2.16 due to ``AnsibleModule`` is now validating the ``mode`` parameter's values (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/596).

======

Release Summary
---------------

Re-release of what was intended to be 2.3.3.

A mistake during the release process caused the 2.3.3 tag to end up on the
commit for 1.9.17, which caused the release pipeline to re-publish 1.9.17
as 2.3.3.

version number has been bumped to 2.3.4 and this changelog entry for 2.3.4
has been added.

v2.3.3
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- Include ``Apache-2.0.txt`` file for ``plugins/module_utils/crypto/_obj2txt.py`` and ``plugins/module_utils/crypto/_objects_data.py``.

v2.3.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release.

Bugfixes
--------

- Include ``PSF-license.txt`` file for ``plugins/module_utils/_version.py``.

v2.3.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature and bugfix release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Prepare collection for inclusion in an Execution Environment by declaring its dependencies. Please note that system packages are used for cryptography and PyOpenSSL, which can be rather limited. If you need features from newer cryptography versions, you will have to manually force a newer version to be installed by pip by specifying something like ``cryptography >= 37.0.0`` in your Execution Environment's Python dependencies file (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/440).
- Support automatic conversion for Internalionalized Domain Names (IDNs). When passing general names, for example Subject Alternative Names to ``community.crypto.openssl_csr``, these will automatically be converted to IDNA. Conversion will be done per label to IDNA2008 if possible, and IDNA2003 if IDNA2008 conversion fails for that label. Note that IDNA conversion requires `the Python idna library <https://pypi.org/project/idna/>`_ to be installed. Please note that depending on which versions of the cryptography library are used, it could try to process the converted IDNA another time with the Python ``idna`` library and reject IDNA2003 encoded values. Using a new enough ``cryptography`` version avoids this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/426, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
- acme_* modules - add parameter ``request_timeout`` to manage HTTP(S) request timeout (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/447, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/448).
- luks_devices - added ``perf_same_cpu_crypt``, ``perf_submit_from_crypt_cpus``, ``perf_no_read_workqueue``, ``perf_no_write_workqueue`` for performance tuning when opening LUKS2 containers (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/427).
- luks_devices - added ``persistent`` option when opening LUKS2 containers (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/434).
- openssl_csr_info - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding (IDNA, Unicode) used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
- openssl_pkcs12 - allow to provide the private key as text instead of having to read it from a file. This allows to store the private key in an encrypted form, for example in Ansible Vault (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/452).
- x509_certificate_info - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding (IDNA, Unicode) used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
- x509_crl - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding (IDNA, Unicode) used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).
- x509_crl_info - add ``name_encoding`` option to control the encoding (IDNA, Unicode) used to return domain names in general names (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/436).

Bugfixes
--------

- Make collection more robust when PyOpenSSL is used with an incompatible cryptography version (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/445).
- x509_crl - fix crash when ``issuer`` for a revoked certificate is specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/441).

v2.2.4
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular maintenance release.

Bugfixes
--------

- openssh_* modules - fix exception handling to report traceback to users for enhanced traceability (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/417).

v2.2.3
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- luks_device - fix parsing of ``lsblk`` output when device name ends with ``crypt`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/409, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/410).

v2.2.2
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular bugfix release.

In this release, we extended the test matrix to include Alpine 3, ArchLinux, Debian Bullseye, and CentOS Stream 8. CentOS 8 was removed from the test matrix.

Bugfixes
--------

- certificate_complete_chain - allow multiple potential intermediate certificates to have the same subject (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/399, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/403).
- x509_certificate - for the ``ownca`` provider, check whether the CA private key actually belongs to the CA certificate (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407).
- x509_certificate - regenerate certificate when the CA's public key changes for ``provider=ownca`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/407).
- x509_certificate - regenerate certificate when the CA's subject changes for ``provider=ownca`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/400, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/402).

v2.2.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular bugfix and feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- openssh_cert - added ``ignore_timestamps`` parameter so it can be used semi-idempotent with relative timestamps in ``valid_to``/``valid_from`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/379).

Bugfixes
--------

- luks_devices - set ``LANG`` and similar environment variables to avoid translated output, which can break some of the module's functionality like key management (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/388, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/385).

---------------

Bugfix release with extra forward compatibility for newer versions of cryptography.

Minor Changes
-------------

- acme_* modules - fix usage of ``fetch_url`` with changes in latest ansible-core ``devel`` branch (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/339).

Bugfixes
--------

- acme_certificate - avoid passing multiple certificates to ``cryptography``'s X.509 certificate loader when ``fullchain_dest`` is used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/324).
- get_certificate, openssl_csr_info, x509_certificate_info - add fallback code for extension parsing that works with cryptography 36.0.0 and newer. This code re-serializes de-serialized extensions and thus can return slightly different values if the extension in the original CSR resp. certificate was not canonicalized correctly. This code is currently used as a fallback if the existing code stops working, but we will switch it to be the main code in a future release (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/331).
- luks_device - now also runs a built-in LUKS signature cleaner on ``state=absent`` to make sure that also the secondary LUKS2 header is wiped when older versions of wipefs are used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/326, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/327).
- openssl_pkcs12 - use new PKCS#12 deserialization infrastructure from cryptography 36.0.0 if available (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/302).

v2.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

A new major release of the ``community.crypto`` collection. The main changes are removal of the PyOpenSSL backends for almost all modules (``openssl_pkcs12`` being the only exception), and removal of the ``assertonly`` provider in the ``x509_certificate`` provider. There are also some other breaking changes which should improve the user interface/experience of this collection long-term.

Minor Changes
-------------

- acme_certificate - the ``subject`` and ``issuer`` fields in in the ``select_chain`` entries are now more strictly validated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
- openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - provide a new ``subject_ordered`` option if the order of the components in the subject is of importance (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/291, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
- openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - there is now stricter validation of the values of the ``subject`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
- openssl_privatekey_info - add ``check_consistency`` option to request private key consistency checks to be done (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/309).
- x509_certificate, x509_certificate_pipe - add ``ignore_timestamps`` option which allows to enable idempotency for 'not before' and 'not after' options (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/295, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/317).
- x509_crl - provide a new ``issuer_ordered`` option if the order of the components in the issuer is of importance (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/291, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
- x509_crl - there is now stricter validation of the values of the ``issuer`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- Adjust ``dirName`` text parsing and to text converting code to conform to `Sections 2 and 3 of RFC 4514 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4514.html>`_. This is similar to how `cryptography handles this <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/x509/reference/#cryptography.x509.Name.rfc4514_string>`_ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/274).
- acme module utils - removing compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/290).
- acme_* modules - removed vendored copy of the Python library ``ipaddress``. If you are using Python 2.x, please make sure to install the library (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/287).
- compatibility module_utils - removed vendored copy of the Python library ``ipaddress`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/287).
- crypto module utils - removing compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/290).
- get_certificate, openssl_csr_info, x509_certificate_info - depending on the ``cryptography`` version used, the modules might not return the ASN.1 value for an extension as contained in the certificate respectively CSR, but a re-encoded version of it. This should usually be identical to the value contained in the source file, unless the value was malformed. For extensions not handled by C(cryptography) the value contained in the source file is always returned unaltered (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/318).
- module_utils - removed various PyOpenSSL support functions and default backend values that are not needed for the openssl_pkcs12 module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/273).
- openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe, x509_crl - the ``subject`` respectively ``issuer`` fields no longer ignore empty values, but instead fail when encountering them (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).
- openssl_privatekey_info - by default consistency checks are not run; they need to be explicitly requested by passing ``check_consistency=true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/309).
- x509_crl - for idempotency checks, the ``issuer`` order is ignored. If order is important, use the new ``issuer_ordered`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/316).

v1.9.4
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- acme_* modules - fix commands composed for OpenSSL backend to retrieve information on CSRs and certificates from stdin to use ``/dev/stdin`` instead of ``-``. This is needed for OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, apparently (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/279).

v1.9.3
======

Release Summary
---------------

Regular bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- openssl_csr and openssl_csr_pipe - make sure that Unicode strings are used to compare strings with the cryptography backend.

v1.4.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Release with several new features and bugfixes.

Minor Changes
-------------

- The ACME module_utils has been relicensed back from the Simplified BSD License (https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) to the GPLv3+ (same license used by most other code in this collection). This undoes a licensing change when the original GPLv3+ licensed code was moved to module_utils in https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40697 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/165).
- The ``crypto/identify.py`` module_utils has been renamed to ``crypto/pem.py`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).
- luks_device - ``new_keyfile``, ``new_passphrase``, ``remove_keyfile`` and ``remove_passphrase`` are now idempotent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/19, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/168).
- luks_device - allow to configure PBKDF (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/163).
- openssl_csr, openssl_csr_pipe - allow to specify CRL distribution endpoints with ``crl_distribution_points`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/147, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/167).
- openssl_pkcs12 - allow to specify certificate bundles in ``other_certificates`` by using new option ``other_certificates_parse_all`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/149, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/166).

Bugfixes
--------

- acme_certificate - error when requested challenge type is not found for non-valid challenges, instead of hanging on step 2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/171, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/173).

v1.3.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Contains new modules ``openssl_privatekey_pipe``, ``openssl_csr_pipe`` and ``x509_certificate_pipe`` which allow to create or update private keys, CSRs and X.509 certificates without having to write them to disk.

Minor Changes
-------------

- openssh_cert - add module parameter ``use_agent`` to enable using signing keys stored in ssh-agent (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/116).
- openssl_csr - refactor module to allow code reuse by openssl_csr_pipe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/123).
- openssl_privatekey - refactor module to allow code reuse by openssl_privatekey_pipe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/119).
- openssl_privatekey - the elliptic curve ``secp192r1`` now triggers a security warning. Elliptic curves of at least 224 bits should be used for new keys; see `here <https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/ec.html#elliptic-curves>`_ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/132).
- x509_certificate - for the ``selfsigned`` provider, a CSR is not required anymore. If no CSR is provided, the module behaves as if a minimal CSR which only contains the public key has been provided (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/32, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/129).
- x509_certificate - refactor module to allow code reuse by x509_certificate_pipe (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).

Bugfixes
--------

- openssl_pkcs12 - report the correct state when ``action`` is ``parse`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/143).
- support code - improve handling of certificate and certificate signing request (CSR) loading with the ``cryptography`` backend when errors occur (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/138, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/139).
- x509_certificate - fix ``entrust`` provider, which was broken since community.crypto 0.1.0 due to a feature added before the collection move (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/135).

New Modules
-----------

- community.crypto.openssl_csr_pipe - Generate OpenSSL Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
- community.crypto.openssl_privatekey_pipe - Generate OpenSSL private keys without disk access
- community.crypto.x509_certificate_pipe - Generate and/or check OpenSSL certificates

v1.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

This is the first proper release of the ``community.crypto`` collection. This changelog contains all changes to the modules in this collection that were added after the release of Ansible 2.9.0.

Minor Changes
-------------

- luks_device - accept ``passphrase``, ``new_passphrase`` and ``remove_passphrase``.
- luks_device - add ``keysize`` parameter to set key size at LUKS container creation
- luks_device - added support to use UUIDs, and labels with LUKS2 containers
- luks_device - added the ``type`` option that allows user explicit define the LUKS container format version
- openssh_keypair - instead of regenerating some broken or password protected keys, fail the module. Keys can still be regenerated by calling the module with ``force=yes``.
- openssh_keypair - the ``regenerate`` option allows to configure the module's behavior when it should or needs to regenerate private keys.
- openssl_* modules - the cryptography backend now properly supports ``dirName``, ``otherName`` and ``RID`` (Registered ID) names.
- openssl_certificate - Add option for changing which ACME directory to use with acme-tiny. Set the default ACME directory to Let's Encrypt instead of using acme-tiny's default. (acme-tiny also uses Let's Encrypt at the time being, so no action should be necessary.)
- openssl_certificate - Change the required version of acme-tiny to >= 4.0.0
- openssl_certificate - allow to provide content of some input files via the ``csr_content``, ``privatekey_content``, ``ownca_privatekey_content`` and ``ownca_content`` options.
- openssl_certificate - allow to return the existing/generated certificate directly as ``certificate`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
- openssl_certificate_info - allow to provide certificate content via ``content`` option (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64776).
- openssl_csr - Add support for specifying the SAN ``otherName`` value in the OpenSSL ASN.1 UTF8 string format, ``otherName:<OID>;UTF8:string value``.
- openssl_csr - allow to provide private key content via ``private_key_content`` option.
- openssl_csr - allow to return the existing/generated CSR directly as ``csr`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
- openssl_csr_info - allow to provide CSR content via ``content`` option.
- openssl_dhparam - allow to return the existing/generated DH params directly as ``dhparams`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
- openssl_dhparam - now supports a ``cryptography``-based backend. Auto-detection can be overwritten with the ``select_crypto_backend`` option.
- openssl_pkcs12 - allow to return the existing/generated PKCS#12 directly as ``pkcs12`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
- openssl_privatekey - add ``format`` and ``format_mismatch`` options.
- openssl_privatekey - allow to return the existing/generated private key directly as ``privatekey`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.
- openssl_privatekey - the ``regenerate`` option allows to configure the module's behavior when it should or needs to regenerate private keys.
- openssl_privatekey_info - allow to provide private key content via ``content`` option.
- openssl_publickey - allow to provide private key content via ``private_key_content`` option.
- openssl_publickey - allow to return the existing/generated public key directly as ``publickey`` by setting ``return_content`` to ``yes``.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- openssl_csr - all values for the ``version`` option except ``1`` are deprecated. The value 1 denotes the current only standardized CSR version.

Removed Features (previously deprecated)
----------------------------------------

- The ``letsencrypt`` module has been removed. Use ``acme_certificate`` instead.

Bugfixes
--------

- ACME modules: fix bug in ACME v1 account update code
- ACME modules: make sure some connection errors are handled properly
- ACME modules: support Buypass' ACME v1 endpoint
- acme_certificate - fix crash when module is used with Python 2.x.
- acme_certificate - fix misbehavior when ACME v1 is used with ``modify_account`` set to ``false``.
- ecs_certificate - Always specify header ``connection: keep-alive`` for ECS API connections.
- ecs_certificate - Fix formatting of contents of ``full_chain_path``.
- get_certificate - Fix cryptography backend when pyopenssl is unavailable (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67900)
- openssh_keypair - add logic to avoid breaking password protected keys.
- openssh_keypair - fixes idempotence issue with public key (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64969).
- openssh_keypair - public key's file attributes (permissions, owner, group, etc.) are now set to the same values as the private key.
- openssl_* modules - prevent crash on fingerprint determination in FIPS mode (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67213).
- openssl_certificate - When provider is ``entrust``, use a ``connection: keep-alive`` header for ECS API connections.
- openssl_certificate - ``provider`` option was documented as required, but it was not checked whether it was provided. It is now only required when ``state`` is ``present``.
- openssl_certificate - fix ``assertonly`` provider certificate verification, causing 'private key mismatch' and 'subject mismatch' errors.
- openssl_certificate and openssl_csr - fix Ed25519 and Ed448 private key support for ``cryptography`` backend. This probably needs at least cryptography 2.8, since older versions have problems with signing certificates or CSRs with such keys. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/59039, PR https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/63984)
- openssl_csr - a warning is issued if an unsupported value for ``version`` is used for the ``cryptography`` backend.
- openssl_csr - the module will now enforce that ``privatekey_path`` is specified when ``state=present``.
- openssl_publickey - fix a module crash caused when pyOpenSSL is not installed (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67035).

New Modules
-----------

- community.crypto.ecs_domain - Request validation of a domain with the Entrust Certificate Services (ECS) API
- community.crypto.x509_crl - Generate Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
- community.crypto.x509_crl_info - Retrieve information on Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
