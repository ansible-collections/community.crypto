description:
  - This module allows one to (re)generate OpenSSL certificates.
  - It uses the cryptography python library to interact with OpenSSL.
attributes:
  diff_mode:
    support: full
  idempotent:
    support: partial
    details:
      - If relative timestamps are used and O(ignore_timestamps=false), the module is not idempotent.
      - The option O(force=true) generally disables idempotency.
requirements:
  - cryptography >= 3.3 (if using V(selfsigned) or V(ownca) provider)
options:
  force:
    description:
      - Generate the certificate, even if it already exists.
    type: bool
    default: false

  csr_path:
    description:
      - Path to the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) used to generate this certificate.
      - This is mutually exclusive with O(csr_content).
    type: path
  csr_content:
    description:
      - Content of the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) used to generate this certificate.
      - This is mutually exclusive with O(csr_path).
    type: str

  privatekey_path:
    description:
      - Path to the private key to use when signing the certificate.
      - This is mutually exclusive with O(privatekey_content).
    type: path
  privatekey_content:
    description:
      - Content of the private key to use when signing the certificate.
      - This is mutually exclusive with O(privatekey_path).
    type: str

  privatekey_passphrase:
    description:
      - The passphrase for the O(privatekey_path) resp. O(privatekey_content).
      - This is required if the private key is password protected.
    type: str

  ignore_timestamps:
    description:
      - Whether the "not before" and "not after" timestamps should be ignored for idempotency checks.
      - It is better to keep the default value V(true) when using relative timestamps (like V(+0s) for now).
    type: bool
    default: true
    version_added: 2.0.0

  select_crypto_backend:
    description:
      - Determines which crypto backend to use.
      - The default choice is V(auto), which tries to use C(cryptography) if available.
      - If set to V(cryptography), will try to use the L(cryptography,https://cryptography.io/) library.
      - Note that with community.crypto 3.0.0, all values behave the same.
        This option will be deprecated in a later version.
        We recommend to not set it explicitly.
    type: str
    default: auto
    choices: [auto, cryptography]

notes:
  - All ASN.1 TIME values should be specified following the YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ pattern.
  - Date specified should be UTC. Minutes and seconds are mandatory.
  - For security reason, when you use V(ownca) provider, you should NOT run M(community.crypto.x509_certificate) on a target
    machine, but on a dedicated CA machine. It is recommended not to store the CA private key on the target machine. Once
    signed, the certificate can be moved to the target machine.
