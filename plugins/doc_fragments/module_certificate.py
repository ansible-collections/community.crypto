        choices: [ auto, cryptography ]

notes:
    - All ASN.1 TIME values should be specified following the YYYYMMDDHHMMSSZ pattern.
    - Date specified should be UTC. Minutes and seconds are mandatory.
    - For security reason, when you use C(ownca) provider, you should NOT run
      M(community.crypto.x509_certificate) on a target machine, but on a dedicated CA machine. It
      is recommended not to store the CA private key on the target machine. Once signed, the
      certificate can be moved to the target machine.
