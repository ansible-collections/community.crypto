module: acme_certificate_order_info
author: Felix Fontein (@felixfontein)
version_added: 2.24.0
short_description: Obtain information for an ACME v2 order
description:
  - Obtain information for an ACME v2 order.
    This can be used during the process of obtaining a new certificate with the
    L(ACME protocol,https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555) from a Certificate
    Authority such as L(Let's Encrypt,https://letsencrypt.org/) or
    L(Buypass,https://www.buypass.com/). This module does not support ACME v1, the
    original version of the ACME protocol before standardization.
  - This module needs to be used in conjunction with the
    M(community.crypto.acme_certificate_order_create),
    M(community.crypto.acme_certificate_order_validate), and
    M(community.crypto.acme_certificate_order_finalize) modules.
