module: acme_certificate
author: "Michael Gruener (@mgruener)"
short_description: Create SSL/TLS certificates with the ACME protocol
description:
  - Create and renew SSL/TLS certificates with a CA supporting the L(ACME protocol,https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555), such
    as L(Let's Encrypt,https://letsencrypt.org/) or L(Buypass,https://www.buypass.com/). The current implementation supports
    the V(http-01), V(dns-01) and V(tls-alpn-01) challenges.
  - To use this module, it has to be executed twice. Either as two different tasks in the same run or during two runs. Note
    that the output of the first run needs to be recorded and passed to the second run as the module argument O(data).
  - Between these two tasks you have to fulfill the required steps for the chosen challenge by whatever means necessary. For
    V(http-01) that means creating the necessary challenge file on the destination webserver. For V(dns-01) the necessary
    DNS record has to be created. For V(tls-alpn-01) the necessary certificate has to be created and served. It is I(not)
    the responsibility of this module to perform these steps.
  - For details on how to fulfill these challenges, you might have to read through L(the main ACME specification,https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555#section-8)
    and the L(TLS-ALPN-01 specification,https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8737.html#section-3). Also, consider the examples
    provided for this module.
  - The module includes experimental support for IP identifiers according to the L(RFC 8738,https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8738.html).
notes:
  - At least one of O(dest) and O(fullchain_dest) must be specified.
  - This module includes basic account management functionality. If you want to have more control over your ACME account,
    use the M(community.crypto.acme_account) module and disable account management for this module using the O(modify_account)
    option.
  - This module was called C(letsencrypt) before Ansible 2.6. The usage did not change.

  idempotent:
    support: partial
    details:
      - If O(force=true), the module is not idempotent.
        If O(force=false), it depends on the certificate's validity period and the value of O(remaining_days).
      - The second phase invocation of the module is always idempotent, assuming no error occurs.
options:
  account_email:
    description:
      - The email address associated with this account.
      - It will be used for certificate expiration warnings.
      - Note that when O(modify_account) is not set to V(false) and you also used the M(community.crypto.acme_account) module
        to specify more than one contact for your account, this module will update your account and restrict it to the (at
        most one) contact email address specified here.
    type: str
  agreement:
    description:
      - URI to a terms of service document you agree to when using the ACME v1 service at O(acme_directory).
      - Default is latest gathered from O(acme_directory) URL.
      - This option will only be used when O(acme_version) is 1.
    type: str
  terms_agreed:
    description:
      - Boolean indicating whether you agree to the terms of service document.
      - ACME servers can require this to be true.
      - This option will only be used when O(acme_version) is not 1.
    type: bool
    default: false
  modify_account:
    description:
      - Boolean indicating whether the module should create the account if necessary, and update its contact data.
      - Set to V(false) if you want to use the M(community.crypto.acme_account) module to manage your account instead, and
        to avoid accidental creation of a new account using an old key if you changed the account key with M(community.crypto.acme_account).
      - If set to V(false), O(terms_agreed) and O(account_email) are ignored.
    type: bool
    default: true
  challenge:
    description:
      - The challenge to be performed.
      - If set to V(no challenge), no challenge will be used. This is necessary for some private CAs which use External Account
        Binding and other means of validating certificate assurance. For example, an account could be allowed to issue certificates
        for C(foo.example.com) without any further validation for a certain period of time.
    type: str
    default: 'http-01'
    choices:

      - The data to validate ongoing challenges. This must be specified for the second run of the module only.
      - The value that must be used here will be provided by a previous use of this module. See the examples for more details.
      - Note that for ACME v2, only the C(order_uri) entry of O(data) will be used. For ACME v1, O(data) must be non-empty
        to indicate the second stage is active; all needed data will be taken from the CSR.
      - 'I(Note): the O(data) option was marked as C(no_log) up to Ansible 2.5. From Ansible 2.6 on, it is no longer marked
        this way as it causes error messages to be come unusable, and O(data) does not contain any information which can be
        used without having access to the account key or which are not public anyway.'

    description:
      - The number of days the certificate must have left being valid. If RV(cert_days) < O(remaining_days), then it will
        be renewed. If the certificate is not renewed, module return values will not include RV(challenge_data).
      - To make sure that the certificate is renewed in any case, you can use the O(force) option.
    type: int
    default: 10
  deactivate_authzs:
    description:
      - Deactivate authentication objects (authz) after issuing a certificate, or when issuing the certificate failed.
      - Authentication objects are bound to an account key and remain valid for a certain amount of time, and can be used
        to issue certificates without having to re-authenticate the domain. This can be a security concern.
    type: bool
    default: false
  force:
    description:
      - Enforces the execution of the challenge and validation, even if an existing certificate is still valid for more than
        O(remaining_days).
      - This is especially helpful when having an updated CSR, for example with additional domains for which a new certificate
        is desired.
    type: bool
    default: false
  retrieve_all_alternates:
    description:
      - When set to V(true), will retrieve all alternate trust chains offered by the ACME CA. These will not be written to
        disk, but will be returned together with the main chain as RV(all_chains). See the documentation for the RV(all_chains)
        return value for details.
    type: bool
    default: false
  select_chain:
    description:
      - Allows to specify criteria by which an (alternate) trust chain can be selected.
      - The list of criteria will be processed one by one until a chain is found matching a criterium. If such a chain is
        found, it will be used by the module instead of the default chain.
      - If a criterium matches multiple chains, the first one matching will be returned. The order is determined by the ordering
        of the C(Link) headers returned by the ACME server and might not be deterministic.
      - Every criterium can consist of multiple different conditions, like O(select_chain[].issuer) and O(select_chain[].subject).
        For the criterium to match a chain, all conditions must apply to the same certificate in the chain.
      - This option can only be used with the C(cryptography) backend.

    suboptions:
      test_certificates:
        description:
          - Determines which certificates in the chain will be tested.
          - V(all) tests all certificates in the chain (excluding the leaf, which is identical in all chains).
          - V(first) only tests the first certificate in the chain, that is the one which signed the leaf.
          - V(last) only tests the last certificate in the chain, that is the one furthest away from the leaf. Its issuer
            is the root certificate of this chain.

          - If O(select_chain[].issuer) is empty, any certificate will match.
          - 'An example value would be V({"commonName": "My Preferred CA Root"}).'
        type: dict
      subject:
        description:
          - Allows to specify parts of the subject of a certificate in the chain must have to be selected.
          - If O(select_chain[].subject) is empty, any certificate will match.
          - 'An example value would be V({"CN": "My Preferred CA Intermediate"}).'
        type: dict
      subject_key_identifier:
        description:
          - Checks for the SubjectKeyIdentifier extension. This is an identifier based on the private key of the intermediate
            certificate.
          - The identifier must be of the form V(A8:4A:6A:63:04:7D:DD:BA:E6:D1:39:B7:A6:45:65:EF:F3:A8:EC:A1).
        type: str
      authority_key_identifier:
        description:
          - Checks for the AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension. This is an identifier based on the private key of the issuer
            of the intermediate certificate.
          - The identifier must be of the form V(C4:A7:B1:A4:7B:2C:71:FA:DB:E1:4B:90:75:FF:C4:15:60:85:89:10).
        type: str
  include_renewal_cert_id:
    description:
      - Determines whether to request renewal of an existing certificate according to L(Section 5 of RFC 9773,
        https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9773.html#section-5).
      - This is only used when the certificate specified in O(dest) or O(fullchain_dest) already exists.
      - Generally you should use V(when_ari_supported) if you know that the ACME service supports a compatible draft (or final
        version, once it is out) of the ARI extension. V(always) should never be necessary. If you are not sure, or if you
        receive strange errors on invalid C(replaces) values in order objects, use V(never), which also happens to be the
        default.
      - ACME servers might refuse to create new orders with C(replaces) for certificates that already have an existing order.
        This can happen if this module is used to create an order, and then the playbook/role fails in case the challenges
        cannot be set up. If the playbook/role does not record the order data to continue with the existing order, but tries
        to create a new one on the next run, creating the new order might fail. If O(order_creation_error_strategy=fail)
        this will make the module fail. O(order_creation_error_strategy=auto) and
        O(order_creation_error_strategy=retry_without_replaces_cert_id) will avoid this by leaving away C(replaces)
        on retries.
      - If O(order_creation_error_strategy=fail), for the above reason, this option should only be set to a value different
        from V(never) if the role/playbook using it keeps track of order data accross restarts, or if it takes care to
        deactivate orders whose processing is aborted. Orders can be deactivated with the
        M(community.crypto.acme_certificate_deactivate_authz) module.
    type: str
    choices:
      never: Never send the certificate ID of the certificate to renew.
      when_ari_supported: Only send the certificate ID if the ARI endpoint is found in the ACME directory.
      always: Will always send the certificate ID of the certificate to renew.
    default: never
    version_added: 2.20.0
  profile:

      - Chose a specific profile for certificate selection. The available profiles depend on the CA.
      - See L(a blog post by Let's Encrypt, https://letsencrypt.org/2025/01/09/acme-profiles/) and

      - Selects the error handling strategy for ACME protocol errors if creating a new ACME order fails.
    type: str
    choices:
      auto:
        - An unspecified algorithm that tries to be clever.
        - Right now identical to V(retry_without_replaces_cert_id).
      always:
        - Always retry, until the limit in O(order_creation_max_retries) has been reached.
      fail:
        - Simply fail in case of errors. Do not attempt to retry.
        - This has been the default before community.crypto 2.24.0.
      retry_without_replaces_cert_id:
        - If O(include_renewal_cert_id) is present, creating the order will be tried again without C(replaces).
        - The only exception is an error of type C(urn:ietf:params:acme:error:alreadyReplaced), that indicates that
          the certificate was already replaced. This usually means something went wrong and the user should investigate.
    default: auto
    version_added: 2.24.0
  order_creation_max_retries:
    description:
      - Depending on the strategy selected in O(order_creation_error_strategy), will retry creating new orders
        for at most the specified amount of times.
